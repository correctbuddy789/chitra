# üé¨ Chitra - The Movie Recommender

### Build 1.0 | Mesa School of Business | Tushar Nain

## Overview
Chitra is a Streamlit web application that helps you discover movies you might love based on your taste in previously watched films. Powered by the intelligent **DeepSeek API** for recommendations and enriched with movie details from **TMDB API**, Chitra provides a ranked list of movies with posters, release years, descriptions, and reasons why you might enjoy them.

## How It Works

1. **Input Movie & Preference:** You enter a movie you liked and specify what you enjoyed about it (e.g., "the acting", "the suspense", "the visuals").
2. **DeepSeek Recommendation Engine:** Chitra uses the DeepSeek Reasoner API to analyze your input and generate a ranked list of movie recommendations.
3. **TMDB Movie Enrichment:** For each recommended movie, Chitra fetches additional details like posters and release years from The Movie Database (TMDB) API.
4. **Ranked & Reasoned Recommendations:** You receive a ranked list of movie suggestions with posters, release years, descriptions, and explanations tailored to your preferences.

üé¨üåü Chitra the Movie Recommender - Build 1.0
Mesa School of Business - Tushar Nain

 ## Overview

Chitra is a Streamlit web application that helps you discover movies you might love based on your taste in previously watched films.  Powered by the intelligent DeepSeek API for recommendations and enhanced with movie details from TMDB API, Chitra provides a ranked list of movies with posters, release years, descriptions, and reasons why you might enjoy them.

How it Works:

Input Movie & Preference: You tell Chitra a movie you liked and, most importantly, what you liked about it (e.g., "the acting", "the suspense", "the visuals").
DeepSeek Recommendation Engine: Chitra uses the DeepSeek Reasoner API to analyze your input and generate a ranked list of movie recommendations.
TMDB Movie Enrichment: For each recommended movie, Chitra fetches additional details like posters and release years from The Movie Database (TMDB) API to provide a richer and more visual experience.
Ranked & Reasoned Recommendations: You receive a ranked list of movie suggestions, complete with movie posters, release years, brief descriptions, and clear explanations of why each movie is recommended based on your stated preferences.
Features
Intelligent Movie Recommendations: Powered by DeepSeek API for personalized and relevant movie suggestions.
Ranked Output: Recommendations are presented in a ranked list, ordered by relevance (most likely to enjoy first).
Detailed Movie Information: Includes movie posters (when available), release years, and concise descriptions fetched from TMDB API.
Reasoning Provided: Clear explanations for each recommendation, connecting it back to your stated preferences in the input movie.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive Streamlit web application, easy to use for anyone looking for movie inspiration.
Error Handling: Graceful handling of API errors and missing movie data, ensuring a smooth user experience.

How to Use the App
Using Chitra is easy! Just follow these steps:

Enter a Movie You Liked: In the first text box, type in the title of a movie that you enjoyed watching.
Tell Us What You Liked: In the second text box, specify what you particularly liked about that movie. Be as specific as possible (e.g., "the complex characters", "the thrilling plot twists", "the beautiful cinematography"). The more details you provide, the better Chitra can understand your taste.
Choose Number of Recommendations: Use the slider to select how many movie recommendations you would like to receive (from 1 to 5).
Click "Get Recommendations": Press the "Get Recommendations" button.
Explore Your Movie List: Chitra will process your request and display a ranked list of movie recommendations. For each movie, you will see:
Rank: The position in the recommendation list (1 being the most relevant).
Movie Poster: A visual poster for the movie (if available).
Movie Title and Year: The title of the movie and its release year.
Description: A brief summary of the movie's plot.
Why You Will Like It?: An explanation of why Chitra recommends this movie based on your input preferences.
